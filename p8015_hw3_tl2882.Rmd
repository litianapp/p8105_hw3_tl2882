# Problem 1

## Read and clean brfss_smart2010

```{r Read_and_clean_brfss_smart2010}
brfss = brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% 
  mutate(response = factor(response, levels = c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))) %>% 
  arrange(year, locationdesc, response)
```

## Problem 1.1

```{r Problem_1_1}
brfss %>%  
  filter(year == "2002") %>% 
  group_by(locationabbr) %>%
  summarize(n_locations = n_distinct(locationdesc)) %>% 
  filter(n_locations == 7)
```

In 2002, CT, FL, and NC states were observed at 7 locations.
